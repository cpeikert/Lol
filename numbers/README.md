[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DanBurton/numbers.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DanBurton/numbers)


I've copied the "numbers" package
to my own git repository
so that the changes from the old version
to the new version
can be readily available and transparent.

I am not the maintainer of this package,
but I am willing (for now) to provide
this repository to facilitate its maintenance.

[edit] Okay maybe I am the maintainer now.
I've put my email in the maintainer slot.

[edit] As of 2014/02/03, John Wiegley is now
the maintainer.
